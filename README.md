# merc-stealth-mech
 A modernization of the SteelSeries Merc Stealth Keyboard designed for use with mechanical switches.

Update: 24 February 2024 - This project was only ever intended as a proof-of-concept. There is a good chance that it will not work, and you should avoid prototyping using the files as-is. They likely need a great deal of work.

With that said, the project is being archived. If you are interested in a mechanical replacement for the Merc Stealth, I highly suggest looking at the Ergo Strafer by the folks over at Custom MK.
